When creating any object, there are **two states** that must persist to the API
Server. These states are **Object Init** and **Object Provisioned**. Any other
state may be communicated between operators by the Inter-Operators Communication
methods mentioned previously.

An object's state may be *watched* by many operators, that will take specific
actions when the state is changed. However, a general guideline is, only **one
operator** may mutate the state of any given object per state. For example, when
a  VPC object is in state **Init**, there is only one Operator that may mutate
its state to **Provisioned**, which is the VPC Operator.

### Workflow management

Mizar uses [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) to schedule and execute
parallel workflows. The operator runs a central scheduler that execute the
workflows.

### VPC Object Create Workflow

   endpoint that is not attached to a POD.
